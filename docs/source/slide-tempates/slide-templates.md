## Slide Templates

Manta provides a collection of slide templates that can be used to create slides for presentations.
Slide templates are copy-and-paste ready and can be used to get started quickly with creating slides.

Components on the other hand are modules, that provide a set of functions to create sophisticated visualizations, like 
icons, enumeration, and other visual elements.
