```{warning}
There is a versioning conflict with the Manim-Editor package.
```

```{note}
There is a versioning conflict with the Manim-Editor package.
Manim-Editor is states to be only compatible with Manim versions up to 0.13.1. 
In my experience, Manta is compatible with Manim versions up to 0.18.1. 
In Fact 0.13.1 is not compatible with Manta. Im working on a solution for this issue.
For now, you can install Manta and then update Manim to the latest version.
